# hello-world

Hello everyone! 

Me in about 10 seconds: 
Creator + Pioneer + Teacher. I love to discover new ideas and work with teams to make them a reality. I have a mild addiction to books, and a serious addiction to coffee. For the past two years I’ve been helping small business owners design systems to grow their business. It’s been a blast, but I’m ready to move on to the next chapter. 

Why I'm on GitHub: 
I'm yearning to build things again. I went to school for Chemical Engineering and I loved the theory and the design aspects.  When I graduated though, I realized I hated the real world application because I didn't want to spend my days in a factory. I'd like to give coding a shot, because I think it will allow me to leverage my problem solving skills and start building things again. 

I'm starting with Web Development languages. Specifically, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have some experience with each, but would like to get to the point that I could land a job or earn money coding on the side.  

Thanks for visiting -- let me know if you have any advice for someone making the transition from Product Managerment to developer.
